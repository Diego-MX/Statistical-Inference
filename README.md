# Statistical Inference Project

This repository contains the project for Coursera's Statistical Inference class.  The project's requirements are described in [this website](https://class.coursera.org/statinference-012/human_grading/view/courses/973520/assessments/4/submissions).  And since anybody reading this, must have most likely already read that, in this document I just include my own comments on my project to facilitate the reader. 

### Sampling
The graphs included in this document replicate the question that were required.  The document was longer as the graphs were forced to begin in a new page, and I didn't find the command/template to do otherwise.  

The appendix includes the file with the code.  I typed semicolons for spacing, as my editor doesn't include blank lines.  

### Exploratory
The analysis in this document was shorter as I didn't have much time to analyse the tests for the length increase.
