# Statistical Inference Project

This repository contains the project for Coursera's Statistical Inference class.  The project's requirements are described in [this website](https://class.coursera.org/statinference-012/human_grading/view/courses/973520/assessments/4/submissions).  And since anybody reading this, must have most likely already read that, in this document I just include my own comments on my project to facilitate the reader.
